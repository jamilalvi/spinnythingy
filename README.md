## You are a spinning rectangle. Deflect projectiles being fired at you and capture other objects FTW!

This game is written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org) using the [Love2d](https://love2d.org/) game engine. Lua is a pretty interesting language and I've always wanted to try learning and using it. The Love2d game engine has some great built-in features and simple deployment options for major platforms so I thought why not use it to learn Lua. 

Other game stuff I've done with PyGame, which is a very good framework but packaging and deployment can be tricky.

#### To run the game:

1. cd to the main project directory (where main.lua is located)
2. run `./scripts/run.sh`

#### To build the game into a cross-platform distributable .love bundle:

1. cd to the main project directory (where main.lua is located)
2. run `./scripts/build.sh`

This will build `spinnythingy.love` in that directory
