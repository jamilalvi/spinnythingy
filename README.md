## You are a spinning rectangle. Deflect projectiles being fired at you and capture other objects FTW!

This game is written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org) using the [Love2d](https://love2d.org/) game engine. Lua is a pretty interesting language and I've always wanted to try learning and using it. The Love2d game engine has some great built-in features and simple deployment options for major platforms so I thought why not use it (other game stuff I've done with PyGame, which is a good framework but deployment is tricky).
